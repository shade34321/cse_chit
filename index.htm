			<h2>Charter</h2>
			
			<p>
				Rising concerns about the ever increasing cost of healthcare in the United States have further increased the interest in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and Electronic Medical Records (EMRs). EHRs and EMRs are crucial to the success of local, regional, and national goals to improve patient safety, improve the quality and efficiency of patient care, and reduce healthcare delivery costs. For example, the HITECH act, which was passed as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, provides significant financial incentives to health care providers and hospitals that can demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHRs/EMRs, and financial penalties to those providers and hospitals that fail to do so by 2015.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				At the same time, EHRs and their implementation raise a number of issues that need to be resolved in order for this technology to find wide-spread acceptance. They include questions regarding certification of EHRs, questions regarding the demonstration of meaningful use, and questions regarding the value that such systems may have for physicians and hospitals, and hence the factors influencing their adoption. Moreover, the aggressive implementation schedule implied by the incentives and financial penalties set out in the HITECH Act is likely to lead to significant human resource needs.
